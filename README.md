This repository contains the ASLBLE project, which is designed to facilitate communication using American Sign Language (ASL) through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a system that can recognize ASL gestures and transmit the corresponding data over BLE to a connected device. This can be used in various applications, such as aiding communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.

## Features

- **ASL Gesture Recognition**: Utilizes sensors to detect and interpret ASL gestures.
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Communication**: Transmits recognized gestures to a connected device.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the system.
